# Conway's Game of Life in Processing

This project was made using [Processing](https://processing.org/), which is needed to run the file. The file was written in JavaScript.

This file will create an 800x800 window that runs a recreation of Conway's Game of Life. There are 40000 cells and each cell has a 50% chance of being either on or off by default. The user can also click to toggle the state of any cell. Pressing 'Space' will pause/resume the program.
